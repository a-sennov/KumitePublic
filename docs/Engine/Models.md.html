Supported model formats
=======================

## DCC exchange
Formats used to export models from DCC tools.

### FBX
Not yet directly readable by engine, must be processed by 
[FBX2IQE tool](../Tools/FBX2IQE.md.html) to make IQE (Inter Quake Exchange) 
file, which then has to be converted to IQM by [IQM compiler](../Tools/IQM.md.html).

FBX is industry standard for delivering 3D models into game engines.

### Wavefront OBJ
Simple, directly readable by engine in development mode, text based format.
Supported by almost every major 3D software. Ideal for quick tests and
prototypes.

### Kumite DAZStudio plugin
Exports models and animations directly into IQE or IQM.

## Directly readable, development build

* IQM
* Wavefront OBJ

Support for legacy formats available in Tesseract (MD2, MD3, MD5 etc.) has 
been dropped.

## Directly readable, production build

* IQM only

All files are automatically converted to IQM in the process of release
packaging.
